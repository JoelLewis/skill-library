## Overview
Fiction architecture is the structural engineering of story. It focuses on the causal design of events (Plot) and the transformation of characters through conflict. By applying McKee's value turns, Campbell's monomythic arc, and Sanderson's "Promise/Progress/Payoff" model, the architect ensures that a narrative has both logical integrity and emotional resonance.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Plot is a Choice of Events (Source: McKee, Story)
Plot is not a formula; it is the writer's strategic selection of events from a character's life story. Every event must be meaningful, meaning it creates change in a life situation and is achieved through conflict.

### Principle 2: Reversing Value Polarity (Source: McKee, Story)
Every scene, sequence, and act must "turn" a value. A value is a universal quality (e.g., love/hate, freedom/slavery) that must shift from positive to negative (or vice-versa) during the action. If a scene doesn't turn, it is mere activity, not an event.

### Principle 3: The Sacred Flaw (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
Plot is the process of breaking a character's "theory of control." The protagonist begins with a flawed belief about how the world works (The Sacred Flaw). The events of the plot must systematically challenge this flaw until the character is forced to change or perish.

### Principle 4: The Monomythic Cycle (Source: Campbell, Hero With a Thousand Faces)
Human stories tend to follow a three-act cycle:
1. **Separation:** The hero leaves the world of common day for a region of supernatural wonder.
2. **Initiation:** Fabulous forces are encountered, and a decisive victory is won.
3. **Return:** The hero comes back with the power to bestow boons on their fellow man.

### Principle 5: Promise, Progress, Payoff (Source: Sanderson, BYU Lectures)
Story momentum is maintained by keeping promises. The "Promise" sets the tone and expectations; the "Progress" shows the hero moving closer to the goal; the "Payoff" delivers a resolution that is both surprising and inevitable.

## When to Use This Skill
- Outlining a new novel, screenplay, or short story.
- Troubleshooting a "sagging middle" in a manuscript.
- Evaluating the causal logic of a narrative arc.
- Designing high-impact plot twists or act climaxes.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- During "Shitty First Draft" generation (where structure should be felt, not analyzed).
- Writing non-narrative technical documentation or neutral reports.

## Core Process

### Step 1: The Inciting Incident (Source: McKee / Storr)
Identify the moment of "Unexpected Change" that throws the protagonist's life out of balance. This event must open a "Curiosity Gap" and set a specific goal (The Object of Desire).

### Step 2: The ABT causal chain (Source: Industrial Scripts)
Structure the primary arc using the "And, But, Therefore" framework:
- **And:** Establish the world and context.
- **But:** Introduce the primary conflict or complication.
- **Therefore:** State the causal result that drives the next sequence.

### Step 3: The Initiation (Source: Campbell)
Map the "Road of Trials." Ensure each obstacle tests the protagonist's "Sacred Flaw." Use the "Principle of Antagonism": the protagonist is only as compelling as the forces against them.

### Step 4: The Value Audit (Source: McKee)
Review each act climax. Does it represent a major reversal of values?
- **Act I Climax:** A point of no return.
- **Act II Climax:** The "All is Lost" moment or the final insight.
- **Act III Climax:** The Story Climax—absolute and irreversible change.

### Step 5: The Payoff Check (Source: Sanderson)
Does the ending deliver on the specific promises made in the beginning? Ensure the "Object of Desire" is either obtained or permanently lost in a way that satisfies the audience's emotional investment.

## Frameworks & Models

### The Structure Spectrum (Source: McKee, Story)
1. **Archplot (Classical):** Active protagonist, external conflict, linear time, closed ending.
2. **Miniplot (Minimalism):** Passive protagonist, internal conflict, open ending.
3. **Antiplot (Antistructure):** Discontinuous time, coincidence over causality, fragmentation.

### The Monomyth (Source: Campbell, Hero With a Thousand Faces)
- **The Call to Adventure:** The "Herald" summons the hero.
- **Supernatural Aid:** A guide or talisman is provided.
- **Crossing the First Threshold:** Leaving the "Known World."
- **The Belly of the Whale:** The point of transition and metamorphosis.
- **The Ultimate Boon:** Achieving the goal.

## Cross-Skill Invocations
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: **character-vulnerability** — because plot is merely the "X-ray" of character.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: **world-building-logic** — to ensure the setting supports the causality of the plot.

## Common Mistakes
1. **Exposition as Scene:** Including scenes where nothing "turns" just to deliver information. (Source: McKee)
2. **Ignoring the Sacred Flaw:** Creating a plot that doesn't force the character to face their primary misbelief. (Source: Storr)
3. **Deus Ex Machina:** Resolving the conflict through coincidence rather than character action. (Source: Campbell/McKee)

## Diagnostic Checklist
- [ ] Does the story begin with an event of unexpected change?
- [ ] Is there a clear causal "Therefore" between every major plot point?
- [ ] Do the forces of antagonism escalate throughout the second act?
- [ ] Does the protagonist move from a passive to an active state?
- [ ] Is the ending an absolute and irreversible change of values?
