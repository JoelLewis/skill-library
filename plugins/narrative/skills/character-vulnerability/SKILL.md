## Overview
Character vulnerability is the art of exposing the "hidden self." It moves beyond characterization (the observable mask) to reveal true character through choices made under pressure. By identifying a character’s "Sacred Flaw" (Storr) and testing their "Theory of Control" through the "Three Sliders" (Sanderson), the writer creates empathetic, three-dimensional individuals that the audience identifies with.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Character is Revelation (Source: McKee, Story)
True character is revealed in the choices a human being makes under pressure. The greater the pressure, the deeper the revelation. A character who *seems* strong but breaks under pressure reveals their true nature; a character who *seems* weak but acts heroically under fire reveals theirs.

### Principle 2: The Sacred Flaw (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
Vulnerability is rooted in the "Sacred Flaw"—a character's fundamental misbelief about the world. This misbelief usually formed as a survival mechanism (Theory of Control). The character cling to this flaw because they believe it keeps them safe, but the plot must systematically strip this protection away.

### Principle 3: Characterization is the Mask (Source: McKee, Story)
Characterization is the sum of all observable traits: age, IQ, style of speech, clothing, and environment. These traits must be used to contrast or contradict the true character. Dimensions are created in the *gap* between who a character pretends to be and who they are when they choose under fire.

### Principle 4: The Emotional Acre (Source: Lamott, Bird by Bird)
Every character has an "emotional acre" they tend. Some acres are pristine and alphabetized; others are auto-wrecking yards. Show the character tending their acre to define what they value and what they are trying to hide from the world.

### Principle 5: The Three Sliders (Source: Sanderson, character lectures)
Adjust the sympathy of a character using three levers:
1. **Likability:** How much we want to be their friend.
2. **Competence:** How good they are at their job or skill.
3. **Proactivity:** How much they act to change their circumstances.
Vulnerability is often created by dialing one slider low (e.g., low competence) while they struggle with high proactivity.

## When to Use This Skill
- Creating a protagonist that an audience will "root for."
- Designing complex antagonists who believe they are the hero.
- Deepening a character's internal struggle (want vs. need).
- Drafting character "backstory" or internal monologues.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Developing minor "functional" characters (e.g., the shopkeeper) who don't need dimension.
- Creating archetypal "Force of Nature" villains (e.g., Sauron) who are symbols rather than people.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Define the Theory of Control (Source: Storr)
Ask: "How did this character learn to survive their childhood?"
- What is their default tactic when things go wrong? (e.g., Aggression, Sarcasm, Hiding, Controlling others).
- This tactic is the "Sacred Flaw" they must eventually abandon.

### Step 2: Dial the OCEAN Traits (Source: Storr)
Establish consistency by setting the character's Big Five personality levels:
- **O**penness: Curious vs. Cautious.
- **C**onscientiousness: Disciplined vs. Careless.
- **E**xtraversion: Outgoing vs. Solitary.
- **A**greeableness: Trusting vs. Suspicious.
- **N**euroticism: Anxious vs. Confident.

### Step 3: Create Identity Residue (Source: Storr)
Show, don't tell, the character's traits through their environment. What do they broadcast to others (Identity Claims)? What do they leave behind accidentally (Behavioural Residue)? Contrast a "perfect" office with a "secret" desk drawer full of empty bottles.

### Step 4: The Choice Under Pressure (Source: McKee)
Place the character in a dilemma where they must choose between two irreconcilable goods or the lesser of two evils. 
- A choice between "Right and Wrong" is trivial. 
- A choice between "Saving your skin or Saving your friend" is a revelation.

### Step 5: The Vonnegut Shape (Source: Vonnegut)
Map the character's emotional arc of fortune. Is it a "Man in Hole" (rise, fall, rise)? Every "drop" in fortune is an opportunity to reveal a new layer of character vulnerability and resilience.

## Frameworks & Models

### The Hero-Maker Narrative (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
Characters (even villains) see themselves as the moral hero.
1. **The Intent:** Why do they believe their actions are justified?
2. **The David vs. Goliath Bias:** Who is the "Goliath" they believe they are fighting?
3. **The Self-Justification:** How does their brain rewrite their past to excuse their current flaws?

### The Revelation Gap (Source: McKee, Story)
- **Level 1 (Mask):** The observable characterization.
- **Level 2 (The Secret):** The hidden nature the character tries to protect.
- **Level 3 (True Character):** The choice they make when Level 1 and Level 2 are stripped away by pressure.

## Cross-Skill Invocations
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: **fiction-architect** — to ensure the plot applies the necessary pressure.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: **rapport-builder** — to translate these fictional insights into real-world interpersonal influence.

## Common Mistakes
1. **The Perfect Hero:** Making a character too competent and likable, leaving them with no "Sacred Flaw" to overcome. (Source: Sanderson)
2. **Backstory Dumping:** Telling the character's history in prose instead of revealing it through choice and action. (Source: McKee)
3. **Inconsistent Voice:** Dialing the personality traits differently in each scene, making the "self" feel fragmented and unreal. (Source: Storr)

## Diagnostic Checklist
- [ ] Has the character's "Sacred Flaw" been identified?
- [ ] Is there a contradiction between the character's appearance and their inner nature?
- [ ] Does the character make a high-stakes choice that reveals their core values?
- [ ] Have I used "Behavioural Residue" to show personality?
- [ ] Is the character's "Theory of Control" challenged by the plot?
