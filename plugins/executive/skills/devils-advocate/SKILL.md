## Overview

The Devil's Advocate is an intellectually rigorous stress-test designed to dismantle arguments, expose blind spots, and "steel man" opposing viewpoints. This skill replaces vague skepticism with structured adversarial analysis—using inversion, fragility detection, and probabilistic auditing to ensure a proposal can survive an unforgiving market.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Invert, Always Invert (Source: Munger, *Poor Charlie's Almanack*)
To solve a problem or test a plan, think about what would cause the *opposite* of the desired result. Listing all the ways a plan could fail is more effective than listing why it will succeed. (Source: Farnam Street, "Inversion")

### Principle 2: Anti-Resulting (Source: Duke, *Thinking in Bets*)
Never judge a decision solely by its outcome. A "good" result can come from a "bad" process due to luck. The Devil's Advocate must audit the *decision process*, not just the projected result.

### Principle 3: Fragility Detection (Source: Taleb, *Antifragile*)
Any proposal that relies on things "staying the same" or has non-linear downside and capped upside is fragile. Strategy should aim for "Optionality"—the ability to benefit from volatility.

### Principle 4: Steel-Manning (Source: Paul Graham, "How to Think for Yourself")
Do not create a "straw man" of the opposition. Instead, build the absolute strongest version of the counter-argument. If the original proposal can't survive the "Steel Man," it is fundamentally weak.

### Principle 5: The Certainty Audit (Source: Duke, *How to Decide*)
We tend to believe we "know" things that are only probable. Force a percentage confidence score on every key assertion. If an assertion is "certain," it is likely a blind spot.

## When to Use This Skill

- When a strategic proposal has unanimous "groupthink" support.
- When an analysis relies on a single high-impact assumption (a "linchpin").
- Before presenting a high-stakes recommendation to a board or executive leadership.
- When evaluating a complex project with significant "downside" risk.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- During early-stage creative brainstorming where critique might stifle ideation.
- For minor, low-stakes tactical decisions where speed is more important than rigor.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Identify the Linchpin Assumption
Determine the single weakest foundational assumption in the overall thesis.
1. **The "What Must Be True" Test:** What is the one thing that, if proven false, collapses the entire argument? (Source: Lafley, *Playing to Win*)
2. **The "Secret" Check:** Is the proposal built on a unique truth, or just conventional wisdom? (Source: Thiel, *Zero to One*)

### Step 2: Perform the Inversion Audit
List all the specific ways the proposal could lead to a catastrophic failure. (Source: Munger, Ch. 2)
1. **The Pre-Mortem:** Imagine it is 12 months from now and the project has failed. What specifically happened? (Source: Duke, *How to Decide*)
2. **Reverse the Goal:** What actions would we take if we *wanted* this project to fail? Are we currently doing any of those things?

### Step 3: Detect Systemic Fragility
Evaluate how the proposal handles volatility and "Black Swan" events. (Source: Taleb, Ch. 1)
1. **Non-Linear Downside:** Is there a "cliff" where a small change in inputs leads to a massive failure?
2. **Capped Upside:** Is the reward for success small relative to the cost of failure?

### Step 4: Steel-Man the Opposition
Construct the absolute strongest argument *against* the core thesis.
1. **Competitor View:** How would a smart, resourced competitor invalidate this plan?
2. **The Skeptic's Evidence:** What data exists that contradicts the author's primary claims?

### Step 5: The "So What?" and Sensitivity Check
Challenge the conclusion's impact and robustness.
1. **The Needle Check:** Even if the author is 100% right, does it move the needle for the business?
2. **The 10% Swing:** If key metrics (conversion, cost, timing) swing +/- 10%, does the plan still hold together? (Source: Gil, *High Growth Handbook*)

## Frameworks & Models

### The Checklist for Misjudgment (Source: Munger, *Poor Charlie's Almanack*)
Audit the proposal for the 25 standard psychological biases, including:
1. **Reward-Superresponse:** Are incentives driving bad logic?
2. **Incentive-Caused Bias:** Does the author benefit from the proposal being accepted, regardless of its truth?
3. **Consistency and Commitment:** Is the author stuck in a previous decision?

### Via Negativa (Source: Taleb, *Antifragile*)
1. **Subtract to Strengthen:** What should we *stop* doing or *remove* from this proposal to make it more robust?
2. **Remove the "I-Knew-It-All-Along" bias:** Document current predictions to prevent future "hindsight bias."

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `mental-model-library` — Use cross-domain models (Inversion, Second-order thinking) for analysis.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `assumption-audit` — To validate the evidence for key claims.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `decision-frameworks` — To structure the final choice after the stress test.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Straw-Manning:** Attacking a weak version of the opposing argument to make the original look better. (Source: Graham, "Think")
2. **Resulting:** Judging a proposal based on a lucky success in a different context. (Source: Duke, Ch. 1)
3. **The Lollapalooza Trap:** Ignoring how multiple small risks can combine into a massive failure. (Source: Munger, Ch. 3)

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have we identified the "Linchpin" assumption that must be true for success?
- [ ] Have we performed a "Pre-Mortem" identifying 3+ specific failure paths?
- [ ] Have we "Steel-Manned" the strongest possible counter-argument?
- [ ] Is the proposal "Antifragile" (does it benefit or stay robust under volatility)?
- [ ] Have we assigned confidence percentages to all "certain" assertions?
