## Overview

Ownership coaching is the practice of developing total accountability in leaders and teams. This skill shifts the paradigm from "Leader-Follower" (giving orders) to "Leader-Leader" (giving intent), ensuring that every individual owns their world, understands the "why," and maintains a non-negotiable standard of performance.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Extreme Ownership (Source: Willink, *Extreme Ownership*)
There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. The leader must own everything in their world. If a subordinate fails, the leader must take the blame and find a path to victory. Excuses are the death of ownership.

### Principle 2: Leader-Leader Model (Source: Marquet, *Turn the Ship Around!*)
Move from "Leader-Follower" (giving orders) to "Leader-Leader" (giving intent). Ownership is built when subordinates provide "I intend to..." statements rather than asking for permission.

### Principle 3: Standard of Performance (Source: Walsh, *The Score Takes Care of Itself*)
Ownership starts with a non-negotiable standard for every role. If the process and the standard are followed with absolute rigor, the "score" (the result) will take care of itself.

### Principle 4: Hell Yeah or No (Source: Sivers, *Hell Yeah or No*)
Ownership requires radical prioritization. If an opportunity doesn't elicit an enthusiastic "Hell yeah!", the answer is "No." This protects the time and focus needed to own the few things that truly matter.

### Principle 5: Protect the Maker's Schedule (Source: Graham, "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule")
A leader owns the environment of their team. For "Makers" (engineers, writers), this means protecting large, uninterrupted blocks of time. Meetings are "exceptions" that can kill a maker's ownership of a project.

## When to Use This Skill

- When a team is "blaming" external factors for failure.
- When a leader is micromanaging and needs to "release control."
- When a project is stalled due to a lack of clear accountability.
- When an individual is overwhelmed and needs to reclaim ownership of their schedule.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- In high-velocity "Wartime" situations where immediate, centralized command is required for survival (unless the goal is to transition to peacetime). (Source: Horowitz, Ch. 7)
- For trivial tasks where the overhead of "intent-based" leadership exceeds the benefit.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Conduct an Accusation Audit (The Mirror)
Identify where you (the leader) have failed to provide clarity, resources, or support. (Source: Willink, Ch. 1)
1. **The Question:** "What am I doing (or not doing) that is preventing my team from owning this?"
2. **The Ownership Statement:** Publicly take the blame for the team's current failure to reset the culture.

### Step 2: Transition to "I Intend To..."
Shift the communication pattern from permission-seeking to intent-stating. (Source: Marquet, Ch. 15)
1. **Coach the Subordinate:** When asked "What should I do?", respond with "What do you intend to do?"
2. **Verify Competence and Clarity:** Only approve the "intent" if the subordinate proves they have the technical competence and the strategic clarity to succeed.

### Step 3: Define the Standard of Performance
Document the specific behaviors and quality levels required for every role. (Source: Walsh, Ch. 1)
1. **Focus on Process:** Reward adherence to the standard, not just the "lucky" result.
2. **The "Non-Negotiables":** State clearly which standards are absolute and which have room for experimentation.

### Step 4: Decentralized Command (Intent-Based Control)
Empower subordinates to make decisions within their scope. (Source: Willink, Ch. 8)
1. **Give the Goal (Commander's Intent):** Explain the "Why" and the "End State."
2. **Define Boundaries:** What is the specific "Left and Right limit" for their decision-making?
3. **Release Control:** Step back and let them execute.

### Step 5: Audit for "Hell Yeah" Focus
Review current commitments and remove the "clutter." (Source: Sivers, "Hell Yeah or No")
1. **List Commitments:** Every project, meeting, and recurring task.
2. **The Filter:** If it's not a "Hell yeah!", mark it for delegation, deferral, or deletion.

## Frameworks & Models

### The Leader-Leader Hierarchy (Source: Marquet, *Turn the Ship Around!*)
1. **Level 1:** Tell me what to do. (Follower)
2. **Level 2:** I think... (Follower)
3. **Level 3:** I recommend... (Follower)
4. **Level 4:** I intend to... (Leader)
5. **Level 5:** I've done... (Leader)

### Peacetime vs. Wartime CEO (Source: Horowitz, *Hard Thing About Hard Things*)
- **Peacetime:** Focuses on culture, long-term vision, and "how we do things."
- **Wartime:** Focuses on survival, immediate execution, and "what must be done now." Ownership in wartime means absolute adherence to the survival plan.

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `feedback-coach` — To deliver the "Extreme Ownership" message without destroying morale.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `difficult-conversations` — For holding the line on the "Standard of Performance."
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `operational-excellence` — To build the "Mechanisms" that sustain ownership.

## Common Mistakes

1. **The Blame Game:** Blaming the team, the market, or the competition instead of owning the failure. (Source: Willink, Ch. 1)
2. **Micromanagement:** Holding on to control because you don't trust the team's competence. (Source: Marquet, Ch. 10)
3. **Ambiguous Intent:** Giving a goal without the "Why," leading to misaligned execution. (Source: Willink, Ch. 3)
4. **Meeting Bloat:** Ignoring the "Maker's Schedule" and killing team ownership via interruptions. (Source: Graham, "Maker's Schedule")

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have I (the leader) taken personal ownership of the current failure?
- [ ] Is my team providing "I intend to..." statements instead of asking for permission?
- [ ] Is there a clear "Standard of Performance" for every role involved?
- [ ] Have we defined the "Commander's Intent" (the Why and the End State)?
- [ ] Are we saying "No" to everything that isn't a "Hell yeah!"?
