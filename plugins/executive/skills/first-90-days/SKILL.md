## Overview

The first 90 days is a critical window for building credibility, momentum, and strategic alignment. This skill provides a structured framework to accelerate the transition, avoid common pitfalls like the "Savior Trap," and reach the "Breakeven Point" where value contribution exceeds consumption.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Reach the Breakeven Point (Source: Watkins, *The First 90 Days*)
The primary goal of a transition is to reach the point where you have contributed as much value to the organization as you have consumed during your onboarding. Speed to value is the key metric.

### Principle 2: Promote Yourself (Source: Watkins, *The First 90 Days*)
Mentally transition out of your old role. Do not rely on the skills and behaviors that made you successful in the past. Identify the specific new capabilities required for this unique context.

### Principle 3: Listen Before You Fix (Source: Zhuo, *The Making of a Manager*)
Resist the urge to make immediate changes (The Savior Trap). Spend the first 30 days listening, asking questions, and understanding the "oral history" of the team. Changes made without context create second-order friction.

### Principle 4: Share Your Operating Manual (Source: Johnson, *Scaling People*)
Explicitly communicate how you work. Sharing a "Guide to Working with Me" reduces friction by clarifying your communication preferences, decision-making style, and "unwritten rules" for your team.

### Principle 5: Second-Order Change Audit (Source: Farnam Street, "Second-Order Thinking")
Before implementing a new process or policy, ask "And then what?" for the 10-month and 10-year horizons. Consider how the existing ecosystem (other departments, suppliers, long-term employees) will react.

## When to Use This Skill

- When starting a new role at a different company.
- When being promoted into a leadership position within your current company.
- When taking over a new team or project with an existing history.
- During the first 90 days of a significant organizational restructuring.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- After you have already established a "business as usual" rhythm (usually after 100 days).
- For routine project management that doesn't involve a personal leadership transition.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Diagnose the Business Situation (STARS)
Identify the specific context of the role to determine your strategy. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 3)
1. **Start-up:** Building a team/product from scratch.
2. **Turn-around:** Fixing a broken or failing team.
3. **Accelerated Growth:** Scaling a successful model rapidly.
4. **Realignment:** Redirecting a team that has lost its way.
5. **Sustaining Success:** Maintaining high performance and avoiding complacency.

### Step 2: Create the Learning Agenda
Systematically map the knowledge gaps. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 2)
1. **Technical:** Products, technologies, and systems.
2. **Interpersonal:** Who has the "informal" power? Who are the linchpins?
3. **Cultural:** What are the unwritten rules and "sacred cows"?
4. **Strategic:** What are the actual success factors and constraints?

### Step 3: Secure Early Wins
Identify 1-2 small, visible projects that build credibility. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 6)
1. **Focus:** Choose projects that demonstrate your unique value and align with the STARS diagnosis.
2. **Execution:** Ensure these wins are achieved collaboratively to build trust with the existing team.

### Step 4: Establish the Operating Rhythm
Define how you and the team will communicate and decide. (Source: Johnson, Ch. 1)
1. **The Manual:** Write and share your "Guide to Working with Me."
2. **1:1 Cadence:** Establish a recurring 1:1 schedule with all direct reports.
3. **Reporting:** Clarify how you want to receive updates (narrative memos vs. data dashboards).

### Step 5: Negotiate Success with Your Manager
Align expectations and secure resources. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 4)
1. **Don't Assume:** Explicitly ask: "What does success look like for me in the first 90 days?"
2. **Resource Audit:** Confirm you have the budget, headcount, and political support required.

## Frameworks & Models

### The STARS Model (Source: Watkins, *The First 90 Days*)
- **S**tart-up
- **T**urn-around
- **A**ccelerated Growth
- **R**ealignment
- **S**ustaining Success

### The Operating Manual Template (Source: Johnson, *Scaling People*)
1. **Communication:** Email vs. Slack vs. Meetings.
2. **Decision-making:** When do I want to be involved?
3. **Feedback:** How I like to give and receive it.
4. **Quirks:** My known biases and pet peeves.

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `stakeholder-discovery` — To map the "informal" power structure of the new organization.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `rapport-builder` — To build trust in initial 1:1s.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `influence-architect` — To build coalitions for early wins.

## Common Mistakes

1. **The Savior Trap:** Coming in with "all the answers" and ignoring the team's context. (Source: FS Blog)
2. **The 100-Day Wall:** Failing to secure a win early enough, leading to a loss of momentum. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 6)
3. **Ignoring the Informal Org:** Only building relationships with those on the official org chart. (Source: Grove, Ch. 8)
4. **Misdiagnosing the STARS:** Applying "Turn-around" tactics to a "Sustaining Success" situation. (Source: Watkins, Ch. 3)

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have I identified the STARS situation for this new role?
- [ ] Have I shared my "Operating Manual" with my direct reports?
- [ ] Have I identified 1-2 "Early Wins" to secure in the first 60 days?
- [ ] Have I met with all key stakeholders (formal and informal)?
- [ ] Have I explicitly negotiated "what success looks like" with my manager?
