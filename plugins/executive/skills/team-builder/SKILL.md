## Overview

Team building is the discipline of creating high-trust, high-performance environments. This skill replaces "surface-level" team building with structural mechanisms for psychological safety, shared consciousness, and empowered execution, ensuring that every member feels safe to speak up, share vulnerability, and align with a common purpose.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Psychological Safety is #1 (Source: Edmondson, *Fearless Organization*)
The primary predictor of team success is the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. Without safety, a team cannot learn or innovate.

### Principle 2: Vulnerability Loops (Source: Coyle, *The Culture Code*)
Trust is built when people are willing to be vulnerable. When a leader admits they don't know something or asks for help, it signals to others that they can do the same, creating a reinforcing "vulnerability loop."

### Principle 3: Shared Consciousness (Source: McChrystal, *Team of Teams*)
In complex environments, every team member must understand the "big picture" of the entire organization. High-performance teams rely on radical transparency so that decentralized individuals can make aligned decisions.

### Principle 4: The Gardener Model (Source: McChrystal, *Team of Teams*)
The leader is not a chess player moving pieces; the leader is a "Gardener." Their job is to shape the ecosystem (culture, transparency, safety) so that the team can flourish and execute autonomously.

### Principle 5: Candor over Honesty (Source: Catmull, *Creativity Inc*)
"Honesty" has a moral weight that can be intimidating. "Candor" is a professional tool. Build mechanisms (like Braintrusts) where candid feedback is expected, depersonalized, and focused solely on improving the work.

## When to Use This Skill

- When a team is experiencing "silence" or a lack of participation in meetings.
- When a project fails and the team is "blaming" rather than learning.
- When scaling an organization and needing to build a "Team of Teams" structure.
- When culture feels "siloed" and departments are misaligned.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- In low-complexity, repetitive tasks where individual output is the only metric.
- In temporary, one-off groups where the overhead of building "Shared Consciousness" is not justified.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Establish Psychological Safety
Create the environment for open dialogue. (Source: Edmondson, Ch. 5)
1. **Frame the Work:** Explicitly state that the project is complex and the outcome is uncertain. "We need everyone's eyes and brains on this."
2. **Model Fallibility:** Admit your own mistakes and limitations. "I might miss something here, please call it out."
3. **Practice Inquiry:** Ask genuine, open-ended questions. "What are you seeing that I'm missing?"

### Step 2: Build the "Shared Consciousness"
Ensure everyone has the same "big picture" view. (Source: McChrystal, Ch. 8)
1. **Radical Transparency:** Share information broadly and frequently (e.g., daily stand-ups, open dashboards).
2. **Context Sharing:** Every tactical update must be connected back to the "Why" and the strategic aspiration.

### Step 3: Launch the "Vulnerability Loop"
Deepen trust through shared risk. (Source: Coyle, Ch. 3)
1. **The Signal:** Explicitly ask for help on a specific, non-trivial problem.
2. **The Response:** Reward those who provide help or admit their own gaps.
3. **Belonging Cues:** Use active listening, eye contact, and "post-meeting follow-ups" to signal that the member is valued.

### Step 4: Implement Candor Mechanisms
Create a safe space for rigorous feedback. (Source: Catmull, Ch. 5)
1. **The Braintrust:** Form a group of peers to review work. Rule: The reviewers have no authority to mandate changes; the creator has no obligation to follow them.
2. **Post-Mortem / Pre-Mortem:** Conduct reviews focused on the *system*, not the *person*. "What in our process allowed this failure to happen?"

### Step 5: Empower Execution (Eyes On, Hands Off)
Push decision-making down. (Source: McChrystal, Ch. 11)
1. **Define Intent:** Provide the "Commander's Intent" (What and Why).
2. **Grant Authority:** Formally state what decisions the team can make without approval.
3. **Monitor:** Stay informed (Eyes On), but do not intervene unless the system is failing (Hands Off).

## Frameworks & Models

### The 5 Keys to Team Effectiveness (Source: Google re:Work)
1. **Psychological Safety:** Can we take risks without feeling insecure?
2. **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
3. **Structure & Clarity:** Are goals, roles, and execution plans clear?
4. **Meaning:** Are we working on something that is personally important?
5. **Impact:** Do we fundamentally believe that our work matters?

### The Braintrust Rules (Source: Catmull, *Creativity Inc*)
- Feedback must be **constructive** and focused on the problem, not the person.
- The director/creator **owns** the final decision.
- The goal is **candor**, not politeness.

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `feedback-coach` — To deliver the candor required in Braintrusts.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `difficult-conversations` — To address "Safety-killing" behaviors in the team.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `ownership-coach` — To build the "I intend to..." culture within the team.

## Common Mistakes

1. **The Zero-Error Trap:** Punishing mistakes, which leads to hidden errors and lack of innovation. (Source: Catmull, Ch. 9)
2. **The Order Trap:** Relying on "Leader-Follower" command in complex environments where "Shared Consciousness" is needed. (Source: McChrystal, Ch. 1)
3. **Surface-Level "Bonding":** Assuming that "team building activities" (like escape rooms) build trust, while ignoring structural safety in meetings. (Source: Coyle, Ch. 1)
4. **Confusing Candor with Cruelty:** Allowing "brutal honesty" that destroys psychological safety. (Source: Catmull, Ch. 4)

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Is every member of the team speaking up during meetings?
- [ ] Have I (the leader) recently admitted a mistake or asked for help?
- [ ] Does every member understand the "Big Picture" and the "Why" of the project?
- [ ] Is there a mechanism (like a Braintrust) for depersonalized candid feedback?
- [ ] Has decision-making authority been pushed down to the lowest possible level?
