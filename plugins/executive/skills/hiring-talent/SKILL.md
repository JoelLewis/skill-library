## Overview

Hiring talent is the foundational discipline of organizational growth. This skill replaces "gut feel" and Demographic-based hiring with a rigorous, data-driven process focused on identifying undervalued traits (energy, obsession, persistence) through structured behavioral interviews and work sample tests.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Hire for Energy and Obsession (Source: Cowen, *Talent*)
High intelligence is common; high intelligence *plus* high energy and "stamina" is rare. Prioritize candidates who demonstrate an "obsessive" interest in their field—those who tinker, read, and build in their free time.

### Principle 2: Structured Interviewing (Source: Bock, *Work Rules!*)
Unstructured "conversational" interviews are useless at predicting performance. Use a consistent set of questions for every candidate, and score their answers against a pre-defined rubric to remove unconscious bias.

### Principle 3: The Rule of Four (Source: Bock, *Work Rules!*)
Four interviews are sufficient to predict performance with 86% confidence. Diminishing returns set in after four. Optimize for speed and candidate experience by capping the interview loop.

### Principle 4: Work Samples are the Best Predictors (Source: Bock, *Work Rules!*)
The most accurate way to predict how someone will do the job is to give them a task that *is* the job. Use work sample tests (e.g., coding challenges, writing assignments, case studies) as the primary evaluation filter.

### Principle 5: The Scorecard First (Source: Johnson, *Scaling People*)
Before you post a job, define the "Scorecard"—the 3-5 specific outcomes the person must achieve in their first year. Interview for the *results* needed, not just the skills listed.

## When to Use This Skill

- When designing a hiring process for a new role or department.
- When evaluating a high-stakes candidate for a leadership position.
- When the current hiring "bar" is slipping and turnover is increasing.
- When building a talent strategy to identify "undervalued" individuals in a competitive market.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- For simple task-based contract work where a "trial period" is more efficient than a full interview loop.
- For internal rotations where the candidate's performance data is already known and validated.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Define the Scorecard and "The Bar"
1. **Outcomes:** List 3-5 specific, measurable results the person must deliver. (Source: Johnson, Ch. 4)
2. **The Bar:** Define what "better than average" looks like for the current team. (Source: Bock, Ch. 3)

### Step 2: Design the Structured Loop
1. **Select Questions:** Choose 4-5 behavioral questions that map directly to the Scorecard (e.g., "Tell me about a time you solved X...").
2. **Create the Rubric:** Define what a "1" (Poor), "3" (Average), and "5" (Excellent) answer looks like for each question. (Source: Google re:Work)

### Step 3: Implement the Work Sample Test
1. **The Task:** Design a 1-2 hour task that mimics the day-to-day work of the role.
2. **Evaluation:** Use the same rubric to score the output. Ensure the task is evaluated blindly (if possible) to remove persona bias. (Source: Bock, Ch. 5)

### Step 4: Conduct the Interview (Searching for Alpha)
1. **The "Morning" Question:** Ask "What did you do this morning?" to reveal natural curiosity and energy. (Source: Cowen, Ch. 3)
2. **The Obsession Probe:** Ask about the candidate's personal projects or "rabbitholes" they've gone down lately. (Source: Cowen, Ch. 1)

### Step 5: The Hiring Committee and Reference Check
1. **Committee Review:** Use a small group (including people outside the direct team) to review the scores and work samples. This prevents "desperation hiring." (Source: Johnson, Ch. 4)
2. **Reference Discovery:** Ask references: "How can I support this person to be successful in their first 90 days?" (Source: Johnson, Ch. 4)

## Frameworks & Models

### The Talent/Persistence Matrix (Source: FS Blog)
- **High Talent / Low Persistence:** Fragile; likely to quit when things get hard.
- **Low Talent / High Persistence:** The "Tinkerer"; likely to eventually succeed through iteration.
- **High Talent / High Persistence:** The "Animal Spirit"; the target for every high-growth hire.

### The Bar Raiser Mechanism (Source: Bryar, *Working Backwards*)
A neutral third party (the "Bar Raiser") has veto power over the hire to ensure the long-term quality of the team isn't sacrificed for short-term headcount needs.

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `first-90-days` — To ensure the "Scorecard" outcomes are realized.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `feedback-coach` — To provide constructive rejection or offer negotiation feedback.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL:** `ownership-coach` — To identify candidates who will take "Extreme Ownership."

## Common Mistakes

1. **Hiring for "Cultural Fit":** This is often a proxy for bias. Hire for "Cultural Contribution"—what can this person add that we don't have? (Source: Bock, Ch. 3)
2. **The Halo Effect:** Letting a candidate's prestige (e.g., "Worked at Google") overshadow their actual performance in the work sample. (Source: Cowen, Ch. 5)
3. **Desperation Hiring:** Lowering the bar because a role has been open too long. (Source: Johnson, Ch. 4)
4. **Neglecting Persistence:** Hiring for "flashy" intelligence but failing to test for the "animal spirits" required to finish hard projects. (Source: Graham, "Hiring")

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have we defined the 3-5 specific outcomes (The Scorecard) for this role?
- [ ] Are we using a structured interview loop with a pre-defined rubric?
- [ ] Is there a "Work Sample Test" in the process?
- [ ] Are we capping the loop at 4-5 interviews to ensure speed?
- [ ] Have we identified the "undervalued" trait or "obsession" of the candidate?
