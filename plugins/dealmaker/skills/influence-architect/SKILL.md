## Overview
This skill provides a strategic framework for acquiring and exercising power within complex organizations. It moves beyond simple "persuasion" to focus on structural interdependence, resource control, and the tactical management of egos and reputations.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Map Interdependence (Source: Pfeffer, Managing With Power)
Recognize that power is necessary because you depend on people outside your direct control. Before acting, map who controls the resources (budget, information, people) required for your goal.

### Principle 2: Manage the Ego of the Master (Source: Greene, The 48 Laws of Power)
Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. Displaying too much talent or taking too much credit inspires fear and insecurity, leading to your replacement.

### Principle 3: Control the "Hidden Plumbing" (Source: Caro, The Power Broker)
Power often resides in the fine print of contracts, bylaws, and rules. Master the ability to draft the documents that grant autonomous authority while appearing technically mundane.

### Principle 4: Visibility Precedes Preference (Source: Pfeffer, Power)
Apply the "Mere Exposure Effect." Ensure your successes are visible to decision-makers. You cannot be chosen for a senior role if you are not memorable.

### Principle 5: Frame the Objective Strategically (Source: Pfeffer, Managing With Power)
How you look at things affects how others see them. Frame your personal or unit objectives in terms of the organization's critical missions or "Common Enemies" to build alignment.

### Principle 6: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity (Source: Greene, The 48 Laws of Power)
One sincere move can cover a dozen dishonest ones. Use honesty or a calculated favor to disarm people and build a "bank" of political capital.

### Principle 7: Institutionalize Your Influence (Source: Caro, Master of the Senate)
Move from individual charm to structural power. Control revenue streams, chair critical committees, or create new rules (e.g., the "Johnson Rule") that make others dependent on your office.

## When to Use This Skill
- When a technically "correct" decision is being blocked by a different department.
- When you are moving into a new organization and need to build a power base.
- When you are competing for limited resources (budget, headcount).
- When trying to pass a controversial initiative through a board or leadership team.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- In high-trust, small teams where transparency and affiliation are more effective than power moves.
- When you have complete formal authority and the task is purely transactional.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Perform a Power Diagnosis
Before advocating for a change, answer:
1. What is my specific goal?
2. Who are the individuals whose cooperation is needed?
3. What is their point of view likely to be? (Where you stand depends on where you sit).
4. What are their power bases? (Source: Pfeffer, Managing With Power)

### Step 2: Acquire "Will" and "Skill"
Focus your self-development on:
- **Will:** Ambition, Energy, and Focus.
- **Skill:** Self-knowledge (reflective mind-set), Confidence (projecting authority), Empathy (reading others' vulnerabilities), and Conflict Tolerance. (Source: Pfeffer, Power)

### Step 3: Build the Coalition
Use Cialdini's "Influence" tactics to recruit allies:
- **Reciprocity:** Give small favors first.
- **Social Proof:** Highlight who else is on board.
- **Liking:** Use strategic flattery to enhance the ego of potential allies.

### Step 4: Secure the "Hidden Plumbing"
Volunteer to draft the proposal, the meeting notes, or the final contract. Use this positioning to define the terms of the debate and the rules of implementation. (Source: Caro, The Power Broker)

### Step 5: Execute with Timing
Wait for "Struggling Moments" or visible success to make your move. Act when the environment is most receptive to change. (Source: Caro, The Passage of Power)

## Frameworks & Models

### The Seven Qualities of Power (Source: Pfeffer, Power)
1. **Ambition:** The drive to take on challenges.
2. **Energy:** Boundless effort that is contagious to others.
3. **Focus:** Concentration on a single industry or functional skill.
4. **Self-Knowledge:** Structured reflection after every major interaction.
5. **Confidence:** Projecting self-assurance to trigger the "Mere Exposure" effect.
6. **Empathy:** Reading others' thoughts and hidden motives.
7. **Conflict Tolerance:** The ability to use conflict as a tool for effect.

### The Perfect Courtier (Source: Greene, Law 24)
- Practice perfect timing.
- Be the bearer of good news (usually).
- Be a mirror (adapt your style to the person you are influencing).
- Never be the "Organizational Hermit."

## Cross-Skill Invocations
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: negotiation-tactician — to close the deal once the coalition is built.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: rapport-builder — to deepen the 1:1 trust required for long-term allies.

## Common Mistakes
1. **The "Just-World" Fallacy:** Thinking performance alone will be rewarded. Performance is only ~20% of the equation; the rest is visibility and politics. (Source: Pfeffer, Power)
2. **Outshining the Master:** Proposing a solution that makes your boss look uninformed or insecure. (Source: Greene, Law 1)
3. **Transactional Myopia:** Treating influence as a one-off deal rather than a multi-turn game of accumulated gratitude. (Source: Caro, The Path to Power)

## Diagnostic Checklist
- [ ] Have I identified the "Job Performer" and the "Buyer" in this power dynamic?
- [ ] Is my objective framed in terms of the organization's "Common Enemy" or mission?
- [ ] Have I made my boss feel more confident today?
- [ ] Do I control the "Hidden Plumbing" (the draft or the revenue stream)?
- [ ] Am I avoiding "Self-Handicapping" (not trying to avoid the pain of potential rejection)?
