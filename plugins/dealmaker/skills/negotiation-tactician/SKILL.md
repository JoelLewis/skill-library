## Overview

The Negotiation Tactician skill transforms bargaining from a "contest of wills" into a structured process of discovery and problem-solving. By combining tactical empathy with rigorous interest analysis and psychological leverage, it enables practitioners to claim value while preserving or strengthening relationships.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Separate People from the Problem (Source: Fisher, Getting to Yes)
Deal directly with people's perceptions, emotions, and communication needs as a separate issue from the substantive deal. Be "soft on the people, hard on the problem."

### Principle 2: Focus on Interests, Not Positions (Source: Fisher, Getting to Yes)
Positions are what people want; interests are *why* they want them. Interests define the problem and reveal shared or compatible areas that positions obscure.

### Principle 3: Exercise Tactical Empathy (Source: Voss, Never Split the Difference)
Listen intensely to understand the counterpart's mindset and emotions. Use "Labeling" and "Mirroring" to make them feel understood, which lowers their defenses and reveals hidden information ("Black Swans").

### Principle 4: Negotiate in Their World (Source: Malhotra, Negotiation Genius)
Treat the negotiation like a detective. Ask "How" and "What" questions to force the counterpart to solve your problem. Understand their constraints and motivations to reconcile interests rather than demands.

### Principle 5: Leverage Normative Consistency (Source: Shell, Bargaining for Advantage)
Identify the counterpart's own standards and norms. People have a deep psychological need to appear reasonable and consistent with their past statements or industry standards.

### Principle 6: Know Your BATNA (Source: Fisher, Getting to Yes)
Always establish your "Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement" before starting. Your BATNA is your true source of power; it provides the "walk-away" point that prevents you from accepting bad deals.

### Principle 7: Aim for "That's Right," Not "Yes" (Source: Voss, Never Split the Difference)
A "Yes" is often counterfeit or a trap. A "That's Right" signals that the counterpart feels you have truly understood their world, which is the necessary precursor to a breakthrough.

## When to Use This Skill
- Salary negotiations or contract renewals.
- Complex business partnerships or acquisitions.
- High-stakes interpersonal conflicts where a resource must be divided.
- When facing an aggressive "hard bargainer."

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- In pure "Tacit Coordination" situations (e.g., merging in traffic) where negotiation costs more than simple avoidance or accommodation.
- When your BATNA is significantly superior and there is no value in a relationship.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Preparation (The Negotiation One-Sheet)
Establish your goal (optimistic but justifiable), your reservation value (bottom line), and your BATNA. Conduct an "Accusation Audit" by listing every negative thing the other side might say about you. (Source: Voss, Shell)

### Step 2: Information Exchange (The Discovery Phase)
Build rapport using the "Late-Night FM DJ Voice" and "Mirroring." Probe their interests using calibrated questions: "What is the biggest challenge you face?" or "How does this fit into what the objective is?" (Source: Voss, Malhotra)

### Step 3: Opening and Making Concessions
Determine the strategy based on the Situational Matrix. If Transactional, open high/low to anchor. Use the Ackerman Model for haggling. Always label your concessions to trigger reciprocity. (Source: Shell, Voss)

### Step 4: Closing and Gaining Commitment
Use the "Rule of Three" to ensure implementation (get them to agree three times in different ways). Finalize the deal with precise, non-round numbers to signal thorough calculation. (Source: Voss)

## Frameworks & Models

### The Situational Matrix (Source: Shell, Bargaining for Advantage)
1. **Quadrant I: Balanced Concerns (Business Partnerships):** Use problem-solving or compromise. High stakes, high relationship.
2. **Quadrant II: Relationships (Marriage/Teamwork):** Use accommodation or problem-solving. Low stakes, high relationship.
3. **Quadrant III: Transactions (Home Sale):** Use competition or compromise. High stakes, low relationship.
4. **Quadrant IV: Tacit Coordination (Traffic):** Use avoidance or accommodation. Low stakes, low relationship.

### The Ackerman Bargaining Model (Source: Voss, Never Split the Difference)
1. Set your target price.
2. Set your first offer at 65% of your target.
3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85%, 95%, and 100%).
4. Use empathy and "No" questions between offers to make them bid against themselves.
5. Include a non-monetary item in the final offer to show you are at your limit.

### The 7 Elements of Negotiation (Source: Fisher/Harvard PON)
1. **Interests:** Underlying needs.
2. **Options:** Possible agreements.
3. **Alternatives (BATNA):** Walk-away options.
4. **Legitimacy:** External standards of fairness.
5. **Communication:** Two-way exchange.
6. **Relationship:** Managing emotions and trust.
7. **Commitment:** Durable, clear agreements.

## Common Mistakes

1. **The Fixed-Pie Bias:** Assuming that for you to win, the other side must lose. (Source: Malhotra)
2. **Compromising Too Early:** Splitting the difference is often a "lazy" deal that leaves value on the table. (Source: Voss)
3. **Talking Too Much:** Professional negotiators listen twice as much as they talk. (Source: Shell)
4. **Falling for Consistency Traps:** Agreeing to an "innocent" principle before knowing the specific application the counterpart has in mind. (Source: Shell)

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have I identified my BATNA and reservation value?
- [ ] Have I performed an Accusation Audit to diffuse negative emotions?
- [ ] Am I using calibrated "How" and "What" questions to let them feel in control?
- [ ] Have I identified the counterpart's "Black Swans" (hidden interests/constraints)?
- [ ] Am I focusing on *their* standards and norms to gain normative leverage?
- [ ] Is my final agreement backed by the Rule of Three to ensure execution?
