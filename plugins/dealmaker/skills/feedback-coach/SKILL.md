## Overview

Effective feedback is the high-leverage intersection of guidance and growth. This skill provides the mechanics for "Radical Candor"—challenging directly while caring personally—and ensures that feedback is received as a tool for improvement rather than a threat to identity.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Radical Candor Quadrant (Source: Scott, Radical Candor)
Feedback must exist in the **Radical Candor** quadrant:
- **Care Personally:** Show you give a damn about the human being.
- **Challenge Directly:** Be clear and unambiguous about what isn't working.
Avoid *Ruinous Empathy* (nice but unhelpful), *Obnoxious Aggression* (clear but hurtful), and *Manipulative Insincerity* (backstabbing).

### 2. Pull Beats Push (Source: Stone, Thanks for the Feedback)
The receiver is in control of what is let in. Focus on creating "pull" by helping receivers recognize their triggers (Truth, Relationship, Identity) and manage their "blind spots."

### 3. Separate Appreciation, Coaching, and Evaluation (Source: Stone, Thanks for the Feedback)
Wires get crossed when the receiver wants one type but gets another. 
- **Appreciation:** "I see you and value your work."
- **Coaching:** "Here is how you can improve."
- **Evaluation:** "Here is where you stand against standards."
Always clarify the purpose of the conversation upfront.

### 4. HHIPP Framework for Giving Feedback (Source: Scott, Radical Candor)
Effective guidance is **H**umble, **H**elpful, **I**mmediate, **I**n-person, and doesn't **P**ersonalize (Praise in Public, criticize in Private). Use "You sounded stupid" (behavior) rather than "You are stupid" (trait).

### 5. It’s the People (Source: Schmidt, Trillion Dollar Coach)
The top priority of a manager is the well-being and success of their people. Coaching is not a specialty; it is the core of management. Trust is the prerequisite for all feedback.

### 6. Destigmatize Failure (Source: Edmondson, The Fearless Organization)
Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem. When failure happens, respond productively by expressing appreciation for the data point and focusing on the next experiment.

## When to Use This Skill

- During scheduled 1:1 meetings or annual performance reviews.
- Immediately after a "teachable moment" or significant success/failure.
- When team members are in the "Anxiety Zone" (High Standards, Low Safety).
- When a "bad apple" (Jerk, Slacker, Downer) is affecting team performance.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- When emotions are so high that "System 2" logic is offline (wait for a cooling-off period).
- In a public forum when delivering criticism (violates the "Private" rule of HHIPP).

## Core Process

### Step 1: Set the Stage (Psychological Safety)
Frame the feedback as essential for the shared mission. Use the "Magical Feedback" phrase: "I'm giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know you can reach them" (Source: Edmondson).

### Step 2: Solicit Feedback First
Before giving criticism, ask for it. "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" This demonstrates vulnerability and models the behavior you want to see (Source: Scott).

### Step 3: Deliver the Guidance (Radical Candor)
Use the **HHIPP** criteria. Be specific about the behavior and the impact. 
- *Praise:* Be specific and sincere to avoid "appreciation inflation."
- *Criticism:* Be direct and helpful. Don't "sandwich" criticism between fake praise.

### Step 4: Manage the Receiver's Triggers
If the receiver becomes defensive, identify which trigger was tripped:
- **Truth:** They think the data is wrong. (Action: "Tell me more about how you see it.")
- **Relationship:** They don't trust you. (Action: Restore Mutual Respect.)
- **Identity:** They feel their sense of self is under attack. (Action: Affirm their growth identity) (Source: Stone).

### Step 5: Focus on Future-Orientation
End the conversation with a clear path forward. Ask calibrated questions: "How can I support you in making this change?" (Source: Schmidt).

## Frameworks & Models

### The Bill Campbell 1:1 Framework (Source: Schmidt, Trillion Dollar Coach)
Structure regular check-ins using these 4 areas:
1. **Performance:** Outcomes, milestones, and quality.
2. **Peer Relationships:** How they are integrating with other teams.
3. **Management/Leadership:** How they are coaching their own people.
4. **Innovation:** How they are moving the needle and thinking ahead.

### The Anxiety vs. Learning Matrix (Source: Edmondson, The Fearless Organization)
- **Apathy Zone:** Low Safety, Low Standards.
- **Comfort Zone:** High Safety, Low Standards.
- **Anxiety Zone:** Low Safety, High Standards (The Danger Zone).
- **Learning Zone:** High Safety, High Standards (High Performance).

## Cross-Skill Invocations

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: rapport-builder** — Feedback cannot be delivered effectively without a foundation of trust and safety.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: difficult-conversations** — When feedback triggers a high-conflict emotional response.
- **RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: operational-excellence** — To align coaching with OKRs and performance metrics.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ruinous Empathy:** Withholding criticism because you don't want to hurt feelings. This is the "Bob Story"—failing to tell someone they are failing until it's too late to fix (Source: Scott).
2. **The "Yes" Trap:** Accepting an agreement to change without discussing "How" it will happen (Source: Schmidt).
3. **Switchtracking:** Changing the topic from the *feedback* to the *relationship* when a trigger is hit. (Action: Address both, but separately) (Source: Stone).

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Am I challenging directly while showing I care personally?
- [ ] Did I clarify whether this is coaching, appreciation, or evaluation?
- [ ] Have I avoided personalizing the criticism ("You did X" vs "You are X")?
- [ ] Is the feedback "HHIPP" (Helpful, Humble, Immediate, Private)?
- [ ] Am I responding to the receiver's defensiveness by digging for the underlying trigger?
