## Overview
Scientific advertising is the application of the scientific method to the art of persuasion. It replaces "cleverness" with "traced results." By using Claude Hopkins' testing rigor, David Ogilvy's brand-building "Big Idea," and Josh Kaufman's business mental models, it ensures that every line of copy is a super-salesman that justifies its own cost.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Advertising is Salesmanship (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
The only purpose of advertising is to make sales. Treat every advertisement as a super-salesman. If you wouldn't say it to a prospect face-to-face, don't write it in an ad. Never seek applause; only seek action.

### Principle 2: The "Big Idea" (Source: Ogilvy, Ogilvy on Advertising)
Unless your advertising contains a "Big Idea," it will pass like a ship in the night. The Big Idea is the unique, arresting angle that hooks the reader's attention and makes the brand memorable for the long term.

### Principle 3: Solve a Human Drive (Source: Kaufman, The Personal MBA)
All marketing should tap into one of the five core human drives:
1. **Acquire:** Physical objects or status.
2. **Bond:** Relationships and belonging.
3. **Learn:** Knowledge and curiosity.
4. **Defend:** Protection of self and property.
5. **Feel:** New sensory experiences and pleasure.

### Principle 4: Specificity is Conviction (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
Generalities like "best quality" are ignored. Specific claims like "softens beards in 78 seconds" or "used by 52 nations" imply evidence and are accepted as truth. The more facts you tell, the more you sell.

### Principle 5: The Consumer is Not a Moron (Source: Ogilvy, Ogilvy on Advertising)
"She is your wife." Never talk down to the reader. Provide intelligent, research-based evidence. Use long copy if the product requires it; people interested in buying will read a volume if it is informative.

## When to Use This Skill
- Drafting direct-response marketing materials.
- Creating landing pages or product descriptions.
- Designing ad campaigns for new products.
- Refining a brand's "voice" or positioning.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Creative writing or fiction (where the goal is not immediate conversion).
- Internal technical memos (where "salesmanship" might be inappropriate).

## Core Process

### Step 1: Research the Market (Source: Hopkins / Ogilvy)
Never start an ad without researching the product and the consumer. Identify the "Problem" the consumer has and the "Secret" your product offers. Use interviews or surveys to find the "Responsive Chords."

### Step 2: Define the "Big Idea" (Source: Ogilvy)
Find the hook. What makes this product unique? 
- Is it a "First to Tell" (e.g., Schlitz's steam-cleaned bottles)?
- Is it a "Price Proxy" (e.g., State the cost of the formula to imply quality)?

### Step 3: Write the Headline First (Source: Hopkins / Ogilvy)
The headline is 80% of the ad's value. 
- Filter the audience: Talk directly to the prospect (e.g., "To men who want 9% profit").
- Offer a service or benefit immediately.
- Use the "You" perspective.

### Step 4: Construct the "Reason-Why" Copy (Source: Hopkins)
Provide the logical justification for the purchase.
- **Specific Proof:** Exact numbers and lab-tested facts.
- **Samples/Trial:** Lower the barrier to action ("Try it for a week").
- **Risk Reversal:** Guaranteed returns or signed warrants.

### Step 5: Execute the Call to Action (CTA) (Source: Kaufman)
Give explicit, simple instructions on what to do next. Use a coupon or a unique URL to trace the return. Every ad must be a test.

## Frameworks & Models

### The "Iron Law of the Market" (Source: Kaufman, The Personal MBA)
No amount of advertising can create value where there is no market. First, ensure there is a group of people who want the product and have the means to buy it.

### Traced Returns / Keyed Advertising (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
- Never spend large sums on a "guess."
- Use coupons or tracking codes to measure cost per customer.
- Compare Ad A vs. Ad B in a "Test Campaign" (local towns) before rolling out nationally.

## Cross-Skill Invocations
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: **resonance-engine** — to ensure the hook has emotional weight.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: **copy-editor** — to prune the ad until every word "tells."

## Common Mistakes
1. **Seeking Entertainment:** Writing ads to amuse rather than to sell. Performers get applause; salesmen get orders. (Source: Hopkins)
2. **Negative Advertising:** Pointing out a rival's faults. It looks "unsporty" and the selfish purpose is apparent. Focus on the "Bright Side." (Source: Hopkins)
3. **Burying the Lead:** Starting with the manufacturer's history instead of the customer's benefit. (Source: Ogilvy)

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Have I used specific, exact figures instead of generalities?
