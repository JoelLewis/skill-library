## Overview
Non-fiction precision is the art of structural integrity and prose economy. It focuses on the "bones" of a piece (structure) and the "concision" of the sentence (clarity). By applying Minto's logical grouping, Strunk's grammatical orders, and McPhee's narrative discipline, writing becomes a tool for strategic action rather than a swamp for the reader to drown in.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: The Answer First (Source: Minto, The Pyramid Principle)
Start every document or section with the conclusion or recommendation. The reader's most valuable resource is attention—earn it in the first sentence by providing the "Answer" before the supporting "Logic."

### Principle 2: Omit Needless Words (Source: Strunk, The Elements of Style)
Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words and a paragraph no unnecessary sentences. This does not mean making all sentences short, but ensuring that every word *tells*.

### Principle 3: Write Like You Talk (Source: Graham, "Write Like You Talk")
Write in the same language you would use when explaining a concept to a friend. If a sentence sounds "written" or "academic," it is likely obscuring the truth. Avoid "fancy" words where a simple one suffices.

### Principle 4: The 1,000 Details Rule (Source: McPhee, Draft No. 4)
A thousand details add up to one impression. Use specific, concrete language to evoke images and sensations. No single detail is essential, but the collective selection must be absolute to what follows.

### Principle 5: The "Six Rules" of Clarity (Source: Orwell, "Politics and the English Language")
1. Never use a metaphor or figure of speech you're used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase or jargon if an everyday English equivalent exists.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

## When to Use This Skill
- Drafting memos, reports, or PRDs.
- Structuring complex arguments or whitepapers.
- Refining prose for executive-level communication.
- Explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Writing fiction (where "Show, Don't Tell" and subtext may require more indirect prose).
- Creative/Experimental prose where ambiguity or rhythmic "padding" is an intentional stylistic choice.

## Core Process

### Step 1: The SCQ Discovery (Source: Minto, The Pyramid Principle)
Define the **Situation** (the context everyone agrees on), the **Complication** (what changed to create a problem), and the **Question** (the implicit need for a solution). The **Answer** to this question is your lead.

### Step 2: The Pyramid Build (Source: Minto, The Pyramid Principle)
Group your supporting points using the **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle. Ensure that every point in a group is of the same kind and summarizes the points below it.

### Step 3: The Lead and Structure (Source: McPhee, Draft No. 4)
Develop a structural "blueprint" before writing. Choose between a **Chronological** flow (if a journey or sequence is key) or a **Thematic** flow (if topics need grouping). Write the **Lead** as a "promise" to the reader that you must keep.

### Step 4: The Strunkian Pruning (Source: Strunk, The Elements of Style)
Review every sentence for three core commands:
1. **Use Active Voice:** Make the subject *act*.
2. **Put Statements in Positive Form:** Tell the reader what *is*, not what *is not*.
3. **Use Concrete Language:** Replace "unfavorable weather" with "it rained every day."

### Step 5: The "Read Aloud" Audit (Source: Graham, "Write Like You Talk")
Read the entire draft aloud. Any passage that makes you stumble or sounds unnatural in speech must be rewritten. If you wouldn't say it in a conversation, don't write it in a memo.

## Frameworks & Models

### SCQ Framework (Source: Minto, The Pyramid Principle)
1. **Situation:** Background context the reader already knows.
2. **Complication:** A change that creates a problem or opportunity.
3. **Question:** The specific problem the reader wants solved.
4. **Answer:** Your core recommendation (The "Answer First").

### MECE Principle (Source: Minto, The Pyramid Principle)
- **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlaps between points; each sub-point is distinct.
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** No gaps; the sum of the sub-points covers the entire parent topic.

## Cross-Skill Invocations
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: None.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: **copy-editor** — for line-level polishing after the structure is set.

## Common Mistakes
1. **The "Nut Graph" Trap:** Burying the main point in the third or fourth paragraph. (Source: Minto)
2. **Passive Evasion:** Using "The decision was made..." to avoid naming who made it. (Source: Strunk)
3. **Jargon Crutch:** Using specialized terms to sound "sophisticated" while hiding a lack of clarity. (Source: Orwell)
4. **Mechanical Symmetry:** Making all sentences the same length/structure, creating a "singsong" monotony. (Source: McPhee)

## Diagnostic Checklist
- [ ] Is the "Answer" or recommendation in the first paragraph?
- [ ] Have I eliminated all "needless words" (e.g., "the fact that", "very", "basically")?
- [ ] Are the supporting points MECE (no overlaps, no gaps)?
- [ ] Does the piece sound like a natural conversation when read aloud?
- [ ] Have I used specific, concrete examples for every general principle?
