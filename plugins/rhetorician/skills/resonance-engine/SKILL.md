## Overview
Resonance is the intersection of neurological engagement and tactical persuasion. It moves beyond "clear writing" to "moving writing." By using the brain's natural bias for unexpected change (Storr), emotional turning points (McKee), and selfish benefits (Hopkins), the Resonance Engine transforms passive readers into active converts.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Unexpected Change as the Hook (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
The brain is a "change-detecting machine." To grab attention, start with a moment of unexpected change or the opening of an information gap. Curiosity is a biological craving (the "Lowercase n" shape); provide enough information to tease the answer but not enough to solve the mystery immediately.

### Principle 2: The Selfish Reader Rule (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
The reader cares nothing for your profit or your brand; they seek service for themselves. Frame every claim around the benefit to "You." Instead of "Buy our brand," say "Here is how this saves you $500."

### Principle 3: Discovery Over Persuasion (Source: Graham, "Persuade xor Discover")
Writing specifically to persuade often feels "salesy" and triggers skepticism. Writing to discover the truth is more influential. Conviction should come from the evidence itself, not from rhetorical tricks.

### Principle 4: Specificity is Authority (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
Platitudes like "best in the world" roll off the reader like water. Specific claims like "softens beards in 78 seconds" or "9% net profit" are accepted as truth because they imply rigorous testing and authority.

### Principle 5: Sensory Metaphors (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
Metaphors that evoke touch, weight, or movement (e.g., "shouldering the burden," "rough day") activate the same neural networks used for physical experience. This makes the writing "felt" rather than just "read."

## When to Use This Skill
- Writing investor pitches or funding proposals.
- Creating high-impact marketing copy or "reason-why" advertising.
- Drafting speeches or emotional appeals.
- Refining a "controlling idea" or theme for a long-form document.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Technical documentation where emotional resonance might distract from literal clarity.
- Neutral status updates or administrative logs.

## Core Process

### Step 1: The "Inciting Incident" Hook (Source: McKee, Story)
Identify the moment of change that triggers the piece. 
- **The Question:** What just changed? 
- **The Gap:** What mystery does the reader need to solve? 
Open the "Mystery Box" in the first paragraph.

### Step 2: Polarity Reversal (Source: McKee, Story)
Review your narrative arc or argument. A resonant piece must have "turning points" where the emotional polarity shifts (e.g., from Doubt to Hope, or from Complacency to Urgency). If the tone is flat, the resonance is dead.

### Step 3: The "Benefit Filter" (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
Audit every claim. Convert "Features" (what it is) into "Outcomes" (what it does for them). 
- **Feature:** "Our AI uses neural models."
- **Outcome:** "Our AI finds revenue leaks in 30 seconds."

### Step 4: Sensory Audit (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
Identify abstract adjectives (e.g., "terrible," "amazing") and replace them with specific sensory details. Use metaphors that hit the "motor system" of the brain. Instead of "a difficult task," use "a hill too steep to climb."

### Step 5: Truth Discovery (Source: Graham, "Persuade xor Discover")
Remove "salesy" qualifiers and superlatives. Ensure the most persuasive point is a "truth" you discovered during the writing process rather than a talking point you started with.

## Frameworks & Models

### The "Lowercase n" Curiosity Curve (Source: Storr, Science of Storytelling)
- **Low Curiosity:** No knowledge or 100% certainty.
- **Maximum Curiosity:** Partial knowledge (The Zone of Resonance).
- **Action:** Provide the context (knowledge) but withhold the resolution (the answer).

### Reason-Why Copy (Source: Hopkins, Scientific Advertising)
1. **The Headline:** Filter for the target audience ("To men who want 9% profit").
2. **The Offer:** A service or sample ("Try this for one week").
3. **The Proof:** Specific, exact figures.
4. **The Action:** A clear next step.

## Cross-Skill Invocations
REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: **copy-editor** — to remove the "verbal false limbs" that kill resonance.
RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL: **fiction-architect** — for the narrative arc of a persuasive pitch.

## Common Mistakes
1. **The Gloomy Side:** Focusing on the dark side (prevention/pain) rather than the bright side (health/success). Positive framing outpulls negative 4 to 1. (Source: Hopkins)
2. **The "Worn-Out" Metaphor:** Using clichés that have lost their sensory impact (e.g., "thinking outside the box"). (Source: Storr/Orwell)
3. **Naive Realism:** Assuming your "truth" is obvious to everyone and treating skeptics as "idiots." (Source: Storr)

## Diagnostic Checklist
- [ ] Is there a moment of unexpected change in the lead?
- [ ] Have I replaced generalities with exact figures?
- [ ] Does the piece focus on the reader's benefit ("You")?
- [ ] Are there at least two sensory metaphors that activate physical models?
- [ ] Does the piece have an emotional turning point (polarity shift)?
